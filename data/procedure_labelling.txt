Step 1: Open ImageJ
Step 2: Open the image you want to label on ImageJ (take the image and slide it into ImageJ)
Step 3: Select the image (click on it) and go to Plugin > Segmentation > Segmentation Editor. Two new windows will open, one black
(which will have the labels and the other is your image inside the plugin)
Step 4: Click on the freehand selection tool (on ImageJ bar there is like this rectangle and oval thing, the freehand is the fourth thing
from the left)
Step 5: Draw around a cell, try to be somewhat precise (you can zoom if you want or do whatever you feel more confortable)
Step 6: Click on the "+" button on the plugin, it will add the drawing the the black image
Step 7: Repeat step 6 for all cells
Step 8: When you are finished, close your image and save the labelled image in the "labels" folder
Step 9: Select your labelled image, go to Image > Adjust > Threshold
Step 10: In the threshold window, put the second threshold to the maximum and the first threshold to 1, then press on "Apply"
This will create an image with zeros in the background and 255 in the labelled regions

--- Additional steps depending on how we want to organize ourselves ---

Step 11: Select your labelled image, go to Image > Duplicate
Step 12: Select one of the two labelled images and go to Process > Binary > Erode
Step 13: Select one of the two labelled images and go to Process > Binary > Dilate
Step 14: Go to Process > Image Calculator and select the dilated image as "Image1" and the eroded image as "Image2"
Select "Subtract" for the operation to be done then click "OK"
This will give only the edges (the outline) of your labels, so everywhere in white the value is 0 and the outlines are 255
Step 15: Don't forget to save your final labelled image
